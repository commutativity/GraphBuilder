# GraphBuilder

The respository provides the source code for the Graph Builder Application which has been developed for the Masterthesis "Generating Graph Datasets: Conceptualization of a Graph Builder for the Wikipedia Encyclopaedia". 

The application provides an approach to convert datasets from the Wikipedia encyclopaedia into graph datasets which can then be imported into graph exploration software e.g. Gephi.
